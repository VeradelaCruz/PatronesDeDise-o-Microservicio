# Online Shopping System

This project is an online shopping system built using a microservices architecture. It allows users to browse products, manage a shopping cart, make payments, and complete purchases. The project is designed to showcase the usage of microservices, service discovery, and API Gateway with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Java 17+** - The main programming language used for backend development.
- **Spring Boot** - Framework used for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Cloud** - For microservices management (Eureka for service discovery, OpenFeign for inter-service communication, and Spring Cloud Gateway for routing).
- **MySQL** - Relational database for storing products, user data, and transaction records.
- **Maven** - For managing project dependencies and building the project.
- **Docker** (optional) - Containerization of the services for easier deployment and scaling.
- **Git** & **GitHub** - For version control and project collaboration.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

This is a monorepo containing the following services:

- **`/catalog-service`** ‚Äî Handles the product catalog, allowing users to browse and view product details.
- **`/paymentMethod-service`** ‚Äî Manages payment methods and processes transactions.
- **`/eureka-service`** ‚Äî Service discovery, allowing microservices to register and discover each other.
- **`/purchaseManagment-service`** ‚Äî Manages the purchase process, from order creation to finalizing the payment.
- **`/shoppingCart-service`** ‚Äî Manages the shopping cart, allowing users to add/remove items and check out.

Each service is independent but communicates with others through REST APIs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project Locally

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VeradelaCruz/PatronesDeDise-o-Microservicio.git
```


### Step 2: Set Up Databases
Ensure you have MySQL running and create the necessary databases for each service. Update the application.properties
or application.yml for each service with the correct database configurations.
```bash
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/catalog_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
```

### Step 3: Run Eureka Service
Start the eureka-service first. This will register all other services for discovery.
```bash
cd eureka-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 4: Start Other Services
Start the remaining services. Each microservice can be started individually:
```bash
cd catalog-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd paymentMethod-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd purchaseManagment-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd shoppingCart-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 5: Test the APIs
Once the services are up and running, you can test the APIs using Postman or any other API testing tool. 
Make sure that the eureka-service is running, as the other services will register themselves with Eureka for service discovery.
